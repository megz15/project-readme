# Project Readme
## _Your personal online book library_

The `Readme Project` (or `Project Readme`) is a _user friendly, intuitive_ and _visually pleasing web application_ built by Meghraj Goswami that serves books and other resources from the notable shadow library LibGen (and by extension Z-Lib and Sci-Hub) by utilizing a modified unofficial API to the service, which by itself provides a minimal API for integration, most of which is documented in Russian.

 This project is to be my submission for the final CS project submission for Class XII. It makes use of Flask (Python), VueJS, Bulma CSS, Flutter & Dart and SQLite, each technology communicating with the others.

## Highlights
- Responsive design, very extremely simple and pleasant to use!
- One of the largest online libraries in the world, thanks to Library Genesis!
- Creation of User Profiles allow users to save books in their own Library!
- Availability of Community tab to share your reading experience with the world!

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to create an easily accessible and easily comprehensible web application that allows users to access information in the form of published work, research papers and unattainable documents, and also fiction and non-fiction works for recreation or leisure, all packed in a beautifully crafted modern user interface.

This project helps people who may be financially incapable of buying printed resources and those who reside in areas where particular books are not circulated.

Anyone with a device that can connect to the internet once in a while and that has support for current web browsers and standards can open and utilize this service. Resources can be downloaded for offline use. The website is fully responsive with support for varying screen sizes, including mobile and laptop screen sizes.
A cross platform application has also been developed using Flutter for Android, Linux and Windows, with features like local storage and network caching.
